<p>You can pass an existing component as content of the offcanvas panel.</p>

<p>
	Note that when using a component as content, the additional node introduced in the markup requires the component to
	have additional CSS styles to be applied if you want the content to be scrollable. See the code sample for details.
</p>

<button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-primary" (click)="open()">Launch demo offcanvas</button>
