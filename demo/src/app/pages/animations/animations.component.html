  <p>
    Animations are implemented with CSS Transitions that use classes defined in Bootstrap specifications.
    You could use your own theme or simply override default styles to customize them (ex. you
    could change the transition duration). Same as with Bootstrap, all animations respect the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
       href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/{{bsVersion}}/getting-started/accessibility/#reduced-motion">Reduced
      Motion</a>
    setting.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the moment only standard Bootstrap widgets are animated.
  </p>

  <ngbd-page-header title="How to setup" fragment="setup"></ngbd-page-header>

  <p>
    Animations are enabled by default. You can opt-out and disable them with a simple flag and everything will run
    synchronously as before (ex. for unit test). You can disable animations at different levels:
  </p>

  <p>
    To turn off animations globally, inject <code>NgbConfig</code> at your application root and change the
    <code>animation</code>
    flag:
  </p>

  <ngbd-code [snippet]="config"></ngbd-code>

  <p>
    You can also choose to disable them by widget type, by changing the widget configuration:
  </p>

  <ngbd-code [snippet]="widgetConfig"></ngbd-code>

  <p>
    The last option is to activate/deactivate them widget by widget:
  </p>

  <ngbd-code lang="html" [snippet]="widget"></ngbd-code>

  <ngbd-page-header title="Limitations" fragment="limitations"></ngbd-page-header>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Animations don't work with structural directives like <code>ngIf</code> or <code>ngFor</code>.
        Unfortunately Angular doesn't provide any APIs to delay DOM removal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most impacted widgets are Alert and Toast. For example, to animate alert closing, you
        will need to use the imperative API, then toggle some flag at the animation end actually remove
        the element from the DOM.
      </p>

      <ngbd-code [snippet]="alert"></ngbd-code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The second limitation concerns
        <a [routerLink]="['../components/nav/overview']"
           fragment="routing" title="Router integration">the router integration with the Nav component</a>.
        As the <code>router-outlet</code> is not directly connected to the Nav, no animation will run either.
        Two workarounds are available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do it yourself <a href="https://angular.io/guide/route-animations">the Angular way</a></li>
        <li>
          Set the nav panels the usual way, and use the
          <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router#accessing-query-parameters-and-fragments"><code>ActivatedRoute</code></a>
          to initialise the active nav with the url information.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ngbd-page-header title="Found an issue?" fragment="issues"></ngbd-page-header>

  <p>
    Playing with animations has been a lot of work, as we had to introduce asynchronous transitions,
    while keeping synchronous code without the animations. This is an important point, as it
    allows to keep existing tests (unit and e2e tests) unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, don't hesitate to report animations issues
    <a href="https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/new">here</a>.
